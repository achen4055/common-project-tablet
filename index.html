            <p class="pet-para1">
              Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days
              lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has
              gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long
              as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to
              avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like
              skills in chasing them.
            </p>
            <p class="pet-para2">
              At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon
              suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on
              a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
              ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.

          <div class="pet-description">
            <p class="pet-para1">
              Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get outside every single day. If he isn’t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping.
            </p>
            <p class="pet-para2">
              Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.

          <div class="pet-description">
            <p class="pet-para1">
              Milktea is a Scottish fold with a personality of a princess. She loves her veggies and refuses to eat anything dropped on the ground. She makes it clear when she has a demand of any sort by complaining in a loud, distinguished manner. If what she says could be translated, it probably would be, “This is atrocious, the water container has been empty for the 3rd time this week. I want to see the manager.”
            </p>
            <p class="pet-para2">
              Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a genetic disorder intentionally brought upon by humans. I highly advise against keeping a Scottish fold because they are in constant pain when they reach around 2 years old. Cartilage accumulates around her paw joints and tail joints and it becomes painful for them to even walk. She is living evidence of human’s cruelty of breeding animals to look pretty while sacrificing the animals’ health.

          <div class="pet-description">
            <p class="pet-para1">
              Cooky is an 11 month old Bernedoodle. He likes to play, run around, go on walks, eat snacks and treats (not his own dog food), get pets and belly rubs, and cuddle. You can usually find him playing with his toys in the living room, chilling in the office room with my dad, or cooling off in the garage.
            </p>
            <p class="pet-para2">
              He’s still a baby, but he can get super hyper. Whenever someone rings the doorbell, Cooky gets really excited, barking and dashing towards the front door. He also jumps really high when he’s hyper and wags his tail like crazy. Overall, though, he likes to chill and cuddle just as much as he likes to play.

            <p class="pet-para1">
              Jax is a kitten, about five months old that I found this summer at a gas station while traveling to Marquette, Michigan. He was scared and malnourished, crying in the parking lot. I took him with me and after some healthy meals and a trip to the vet he is doing great!
            </p>
            <p class="pet-para2">
              My roommates and I just recently moved and Jax has been having a hard time getting used to the large house since we were previously living in a small apartment. Jax is incredibly playful and loves to run around, but when he is sleepy he is happy to be held.

              Chief is a 9 year old pomeranian who loves to sleep as much as he can. He naps anywhere, ranging from someone's bed to the grass outside. He enjoys walking outside, but keep watch of him, otherwise he will try to consume geese poop.

              He does not like any toys anymore as when he was younger, he watched a bigger toy shred his favorite one to pieces. He used to know how to roll over, but now replaced that memory with a spin as it is much easier.
